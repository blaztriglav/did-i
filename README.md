What is Did I?
============

Did I? is a habit tracking app for Android 4.0+ which asks you a simple question about your habit every day: "Did I?" Enter the habits you want to build, and what time of day you want the app to ask you about them, and that's that.

[Google Play](http://play.google.com)

Potentially frequently asked questions
============

* Why make another habit tracking app?

Because I wanted to make one that does exactly what I want, no more no less, plus it's been a while since I did any coding for fun.

* Why can I only add 5 habits?

Establishing one new positive habit is hard enough. 5 seems like a decent limit for now, though I've contemplated cutting it down to 3. Expanding the limit by editing the code shouldn't take much if you are so inclined.

* How do I delete habits?

In the edit screen, long press on the habit you want to delete.

* Why only Android 4.0+?

Laziness for now. Considering how simple the app is, it shouldn't be too hard porting it to 2.2 or 2.3+ with ActionBarSherlock.

* How do you draw the charts?

With [AChartEngine](http://www.achartengine.org/).

* Your code is quite strange in parts.

I started coding/copy-pasting from Google and StackOverflow a year ago, so the code quality leaves a lot to be desired. If anyone wishes to demonstrate how a real programmer would code this, please do, as that would be an immense learning opportunity for me.

The parts that aren't that strange in the code (namely the database), are from my friend @Nordak, who has patiently helped me out, and managed to control his temper while trying to figure out what the hell I am doing in the code.

* Will this app be developed further?

Minor features will get added in the future, such as goals per habit and weekly report cards. Generally though, it's supposed to fulfill one specific goal for me, to keep myself accountable daily for the habits I want to establish, and for that purpose it's pretty much complete.

It is open source, so anyone who wants to take it and make it better is welcome to do so!
